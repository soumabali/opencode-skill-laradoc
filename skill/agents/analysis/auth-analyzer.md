Never assume authentication type.

Trace:

- config/auth.php
- guards and providers
- login controllers
- Sanctum / Passport / JWT / Session
- middleware verification

Identify:

- token/session lifecycle
- role/permission system
- policy usage

Output:

- verified auth architecture
- flow from login → protected routes
